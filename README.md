1. Make sure our local main branch is up to date with our remote main branch
    - 'git pull origin main' on the 'main' brnch
2. Create a new branch off the main branch (locally)
    - git checkout -b feature/{feauture-name}
    -feature/add-navaigation
    -feature/add-form
    -feature/style-hompage
    - BAD: feauture/Bob
3. Write our Code

- push to remote often
- make sure our work is small -- ideally the work on this branch should laste hours, not days.
4. Push our final working code to remote (github)
